# PuyoInspired

A Puyo-Puyo styled project that attempts to recreate the game as much as possible, while changing things up slightly.
These differences include extra game modes, smaller sprites, and customizable shapes for your pieces. This also shows an example of the same character having different sprites based on which board they're on.

You match 4 or more of the same pieces to create a chain. If you offset your pieces so they'll pop after each other, you'll be able to increase your chain. Anything higher than 1 will send garbage pieces to the other board, which cannot be blocked. You can destroy the garbage pieces by making a chain of any kind directly adjacent to the pieces (corners don't count). If you or your opponent's pieces touch the red X at the top of your board, then the game's over.
